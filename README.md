# Python_WebCam_Face_Detection
This is a Python Program that Detects the Faces through your WebCam. It uses OpenCV Python Module for this Purpose. To install this in your system just Use the following Command (Assuming that you are on Windows):
```
pip install opencv-python
```
Or if you are on Ubuntu (10.04 LTS which I use) then just type:
```
pip3 install opencv-python
```
Or Install it according to your OS. After Installation follow the Following Instructions:
1. Install the 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml' by going to this [Link ](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml).
2. After visiting click on 'Raw':
